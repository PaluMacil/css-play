# CSS Play

## What is this?

Simple playing with CSS. I'm demonstrating some Flexbox, Sass, and TypeScript concepts with source watching but 
without relying upon Webpack. In a real project, Webpack might be necessary to create a more optimized production
build, but this setup is good for demonstrating concepts, playing with layout (like weird fonts), and might be suitable
for Electron apps. No UI "frameworks" will be used, including Angular, React, or Vue, and also including style 
libraries such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI, PatternFly, Skeleton, or Foundation.

## Setup and Run

Requires Node and NPM (included in the install of Node).

```
npm install
npm start
```
